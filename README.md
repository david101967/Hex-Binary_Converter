* The operator ^ compares two bits and returns 1 if exactly one of the bits is 1 and the other is 0. If both bits are the same (both 0 or both 1), it returns 0.
* The operator & will It compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand. If both bits are 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.
* the operator | will It compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand. If at least one of the bits is 1, it returns 1. If both bits are 0, it returns 0.
